    "## Summary\n",
    "The logistic regression model demonstrates a high accuracy of 99%. The precision and recall scores for predicting healthy loans are perfect, while the precision and recall for predicting high-risk loans are lower but still quite high. Given the imbalance in the dataset (with a significantly higher number of healthy loans compared to high-risk loans), the model performs well overall. However, for critical applications, further evaluation and potentially additional models or techniques (e.g., handling class imbalance) might be necessary to ensure the robustness of high-risk loan predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on these results, the model is recommended for use in predicting loan defaults, but it is advised to continue monitoring and improving the model, especially in terms of high-risk loan predictions.\n",
